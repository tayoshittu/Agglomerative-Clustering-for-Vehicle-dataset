# Agglomerative-Clustering-for-Vehicle-dataset
Agglomerative Clustering for vehicle dataset using scipy and scikit-learn.

It is obvious that we have 3 main clusters with the majority of vehicles in those.

### Cars:

Cluster 1: with almost high mpg, and low in horsepower.

Cluster 2: with good mpg and horsepower, but higher price than average.

Cluster 3: with low mpg, high horsepower, highest price.

### Trucks:

Cluster 1: with almost highest mpg among trucks, and lowest in horsepower and price.

Cluster 2: with almost low mpg and medium horsepower, but higher price than average.

Cluster 3: with good mpg and horsepower, low price.
